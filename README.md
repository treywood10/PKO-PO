Welcome to my repository! This repository is for my project entitled ''Highly-Valued Peacekeepers.'' I developed this project during my Political Behavior course in my 2nd-year of the Ph.D. program. While not directly tied to my dissertation, I was able to leverage World Values Survey data to consider when individuals prefer the United Nations to lead peacekeeping efforts, compared to regional organization or state-led efforts. This project is currently under review. 

Since this project was developed early in my graduate career, I build and analyzed the dataset in STATA. I also estimated the marginal effects in STATA, which were exported to R to make graphs.
